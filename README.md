# This Code repository for the paper "How Best to Explain Machine Learning Models to Clinicians: A User Study of Explanation Types in a Clinical Setting"

### Code used to generate the analyses in the paper can be found in the "code_analysis/" folder. 
To replicate results, please ensure you have the raw survey responses in the correct folder location and run the "Combined_Analysis_V5.ipynb" jupyter notebook.

### Code used to generate the explanations from the pre-trained clinical risk deterioration model can be found in the "code_explanation_generation/" folder.
Each of the "AnchorsNotebook.ipynb", "COMTENotebook.ipynb", and "Integrated_grads.ipynb" jupyter notebooks can be run to generate the explanations.

### Data:
The explanations generated for the synthetic cases can be found in the "synthetic_data_explanations/" folder.
The sythetic patient data tables can be found in the "synthetic_raw_data/" folder.
Please note: All data in this repository is *synthetic* data.
